Each pie contains eight commonly used tools, for a total of 40 (so far)!</p><hr /><p><h3>How to Use</h3>You'll need the following three extensions installed:<ol><li><b>openHarmony</b> - this is required for pie menus to work</li><li><b>AP_PieMenus</b> - that's why we're here</li><li><b>ScriptShortcuts</b> - this adds a Pie Menu category in Harmony\'s Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts list</li></ol></p> <p>Now go to <i>Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts</i> and you should see a brand new Pie Menus category. Why not use your brush tool keyboard shortcut [B] to bring up the Painting pie menu? That's what I did anyway, but hey that's up to you I suppose.</p><p>Requires openHarmony 0.2.8</p>",
